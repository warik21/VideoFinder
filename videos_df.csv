This piece of work is not meant to be a highly useful application, only a tongue in cheek jab at the rising trend of trying to solve simple problems using deep learning without carefully examining the problem at hand. As always, we note that all intuitive explanations are wrong, but some are helpful, and the most precise way to express these thoughts can be done by using mathematics. However, we shall leave that to the textbooks and will try to understand these concepts by floating about on the wings of intuition. In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array in which we can store numbers and symbols. Matrices can be interpreted in many ways, for instance, we can think of them as transformations. Multiplying a matrix with a vector means applying this transform to the vector, such as scaling, rotation or shearing. The rank of a matrix can be intuitively explained in many ways. My favorite intuition is that the rank encodes the information content of the matrix. For instance, in an earlier work on Separable Subsurface Scattering, we recognized that many of these matrices that encode light scattering inside translucent materials, are of relatively low rank. This means that the information within is highly structured and it is not random noise. And from this low rank property follows that we can compress and represent this phenomenon using simpler data structures, leading to an extremely efficient algorithm to simulate light scattering within our skin. However, the main point is that finding out the rank of a large matrix is an expensive operation. It is also important to note that we can also visualize these matrices by mapping the numbers within to different colors. As a fun sidenote, the paper finds, that the uglier the colorscheme is, the better suited it is for learning. This way, after computing the ranks of many matrices, we can create a lot of input images and output ranks for the neural network to learn on. After that, the goal is that we feed in an unknown matrix in the form of an image, and the network would have to guess what the rank is. It is almost like having an expert scientist unleash his intuition on such a matrix, much like a fun guessing game for intoxicated mathematicians.""",Estimating Matrix Rank With Neural Networks | Two Minute Papers #94,Two Minute Papers

The technique involves sampling light paths in a specific way to achieve a desired visual result. The key idea behind Metropolis Light Transport is to sample light paths more often in areas where the light is brighter and less often in areas where the light is darker. This allows the algorithm to create more realistic and natural-looking light effects. Summary extraction error: Unexpected response format. Summary extraction error: Unexpected response format. Light paths are a fascinating topic in computer vision, where algorithms are developed to generate new and realistic light patterns. The original metropolis light transport algorithm, published in 1997, is considered one of the most significant contributions to this field. It has a unique mutation strategy that allows it to generate diverse and complex light patterns. However, implementing the algorithm correctly has proven challenging due to its complexity and lack of widespread understanding.

In recent years, several researchers have developed simplified versions of the metropolis algorithm, including one implemented by Google's Vensa Yaco in 2010. This simplified version is relatively easy to implement but still produces high-quality light patterns. Another simplified version was developed by Chabot Kellerman and Lucille from my former university, which is even more robust but still relatively simple to implement.

The metropolis algorithm has found applications in various fields, including advertising, computer graphics, and scientific research. It is particularly useful for generating light patterns that are difficult or impossible to create with other algorithms. The video discusses the Metropolis light transport algorithm, a method for rendering images by simulating the propagation of light through a scene. The algorithm takes into consideration the complexity of the scene and the number of samples required to achieve a desired level of quality.

When rendering a scene with the Metropolis algorithm, it starts with a biased light distribution that is gradually refined to create a more accurate representation of the scene. The algorithm can be used to render both easy and difficult scenes, with the quality of the final image depending on the complexity of the scene. The video showcases the Metropolis light transport algorithm, a technique for generating high-quality images by gradually adjusting the light paths in an image. The algorithm converges caustics quickly and efficiently, resulting in sharp and detailed images. However, when applied to a complex and noisy scene, the algorithm struggles to converge due to the presence of numerous and highly localized light sources. This results in a failure case that highlights the limitations of the algorithm in such scenarios.",TU Wien Rendering #33 - Metropolis Light Transport,Two Minute Papers

MIS is a powerful technique that can be used to render a variety of ""packed"" scenes with lots of occlusions with ease. It works by connecting two light paths together, one from the camera and one from the light source. This allows one light path to be obtained with different probabilities, as if we were running multiple Monte Carlo integration processes. MIS is one of the most powerful techniques in all photorealistic rendering research.","The video discusses the motivation behind the algorithm used for global illumination. The algorithm involves tracing light paths from the camera to the light source and then computing the total intensity of the light at each point in the scene. The algorithm is simple and efficient, but it can be computationally expensive for scenes with complex lighting conditions. Despite this, the algorithm is effective for scenes with well-defined light sources and objects. The video describes a technique called bi-directional path tracing, which involves sending out shadow rays after every bounce and combining these light paths together to increase the chances of hitting the light source. This technique is more effective for indoor scenes compared to standard path tracing due to the smaller size of the object and the presence of multiple light sources. The video discusses multiple important sampling, a technique that combines two different path tracing techniques to improve convergence. The technique involves adding noise to the images to create a more intuitive representation that can be used to train a model. By taking different numbers of steps from the light source, the technique can capture both the local and global features of an image. However, it can also be computationally expensive and may not always produce accurate results. The video discusses a technique for creating highly converged images by combining multiple sampling strategies. The technique involves taking a large number of samples from specific regions of the image and weighting them accordingly to create a final image. This method is particularly effective for scenes where light sources are not present or when caustics need to be sampled efficiently. The video provides an overview of a technique called bi-directional path tracing, which is a method for rendering images that accurately simulates the physical behavior of light. The technique involves tracing the paths of light rays in both directions (from the object to the camera and vice versa) and combining the results to create a final image.

The lecture introduces the concept of kd trees and bounding volume hierarchies as two main techniques used for multicolour rendering. The video describes a method for dividing a 3D space into smaller subspaces by finding criteria that minimize the number of triangle intersections. The method involves placing cut planes through the space, dividing the subspaces recursively, and checking the intersection of the cut lines with the objects in each subspace. The goal is to find a set of cut planes that minimizes the number of triangle intersections while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Cutting a lot of scene content is computationally expensive, so this would tend to create the performance of the KD tree generation bounding volume hierarchies are very popular for GPUs and multi-core architectures, so the scene file for example so they got more attention in the recent research because it is because most of the current work tried to implement so the spatial hierarchy generation on GPUs or other highly parallel architectures they are also easier to update because imagine you have a moving object inside your scene, a key d3 cuts the whole volume apart and then if you have an object moving from one subvolume to another you would have to update the whole key t3 because you don't really have a grasp on at which level you have to edit it bounding volume hierarchies on the other side the group objects together so there you can just you have the option of ignoring dynamic complexity because say you have to object and B that are close together so you generate your bounding volume hierarchy so they are grouped together at some level of the tree and if they then move apart the grouping is not influenced by the only thing that happens is that the bounding volume that holds both groups gets larger and larger so what happens is that your spatial hierarchy gets more inefficient because say a lot of empty space is generated in between object a and B so three-race the travel exactly through this gap between them they would still have to check a and B if you would then update your bounding volume hierarchy to acknowledge that they are spatially separated then they would be put into different branches of the tree at a different level but you don't have to do that so in bounding volume hierarchies dynamic seems just degrade your performance at don't invalidate your whole hierarchy because in KT trees if you move from one SAP volume to the other you have to update this in the whole tree and this put quite complicated because traversing the tree for highly dynamic scene can be very costly I mean you and another advantage for bounding volume hierarchies is that they are that every object is only in one tree leaf, this is naturally because it's constructed that way but a negative point of them are that the nodes can spatially overlap so if you put two triangles that are close by other in two different nodes of the bounding volume hierarchy then you still generate the box around them to do a fast intersection test but if those triangles are say see right next to each other then a simple box will have some overlap so the bounding volume hierarchy can be inefficient if you generate a lot of boxes with content in it that overlap to a large extent.",TU Wien Rendering #19 - Space Partitioning 1,Two Minute Papers

The video explains that we can often throw away half of the objects with every intersection test, which can save computational time.","The video discusses the concept of bounding volume hierarchies and how they can be used to optimize the performance of light simulations. The main idea is that the optimal hierarchy for a given scene can vary depending on the specific conditions, but in general, surface area heuristics are a popular choice as they provide a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. The video describes a task of minimizing the surface area of a bounding box while maintaining a large surface area of the root. This task is particularly challenging for dynamic scenes, where the bounding box can grow or shrink as objects move around.

The solution involves using different heuristics to determine how to group the objects in the scene. The surface area heuristic assumes random ray distribution and infinite length rays, while the kd tree propagation method takes into account the spatial subdivision of the tree.

The optimal tree is not necessarily unique, but there are methods to approximate it with good enough quality for the purpose. The more time spent on building the hierarchy, the better its quality and efficiency. Light simulation is a process that involves tracing a large number of rays to create an image. The cost of this process is very low if the number of rays is kept low, but it increases significantly as the number of rays increases. The optimal number of rays for a given simulation can be found by experimenting with different values.

The video also discusses different methods for generating spatial hierarchies, including the bounding volume hierarchy (sbvh), the hierarchical bounding volume hierarchy (hbhv), and the surface area heuristic (sbbh). The bounding volume hierarchy is a simple but effective method that can be used to generate high-quality spatial hierarchies. However, it is very slow for simulations with a large number of rays.

The hierarchical bounding volume hierarchy is a more efficient method than the bounding volume hierarchy, but it can still produce high-quality results. The surface area heuristic is a fast and efficient method that can be used to generate spatial hierarchies for scenes with a small number of rays. However, it is not as accurate as the other methods.

The video concludes by discussing a new method for generating spatial hierarchies that is faster than the bounding volume hierarchy but still produces high-quality results. This method is based on the idea of using a grid of points to represent the scene and then using a genetic algorithm to find the best way to connect these points.

The video focuses on the challenges of displaying realistic scenarios with a standard display due to the high dynamic range of brightness values. To address this, the technique of tone mapping is introduced to compress the range of output, resulting in a more suitable display for such scenarios. The video discusses different approaches to tone mapping, including exponential mapping and the Rhinehart tone mapper. These methods are used to enhance the contrast and color of an image by adjusting the tonal values in a scene. The Rhinehart tone mapper is a more sophisticated approach that can be used to combine multiple exposures of the same scene into one image. The video focuses on the process of combining different exposures to create a more realistic image. The technique used for this purpose is tone mapping, which involves dividing the image into two large classes: global and local tone mappers. The global tone map is used to convert radiance at a certain pixel to an RTP value, while the local tone map takes into account both the single pixel and its neighbors.

The global approach involves computing a single average of the image, while the local approach involves computing a kernel function for each pixel and then applying that kernel to the entire image. The global approach is faster but does not give you all the possibilities that your eye would give you, while the local approach is much more contrast in the cupula path or the mosaics on the church room, but it is slower. The video describes a process of mapping the luminance values of a scene to a new range of values, with the goal of enhancing the contrast and visual appeal of the image. The process involves compressing high-value regions of the image and stretching low-value regions, resulting in a more balanced and detailed representation. The video discusses the process of determining the local scale of an image. The local scale is a measure of how smooth the image is at a particular point. By determining the local scale, we can improve the contrast of an image by compressing or expanding the image in certain areas.

The video first introduces the concept of local scale and then provides a step-by-step explanation of how to determine it. The video uses a series of images to illustrate the concept of local scale, and it provides a clear and concise explanation of how to apply this concept to an image. The video discusses different approaches for preserving the details in an image, including the reinhardt scale estimation, bilateral filtering, and gradient processing. The reinhardt scale estimation focuses on preserving the local brightness values, while bilateral filtering stops the filtering process at edges and then applies a bilateral filter to preserve the contrast. Gradient processing compresses the range of bright spots in an image, preserving the details in the dimly illuminated regions. The video discusses the process of reverse engineering a video by combining both local and global approaches. The goal is to recover the original signal from a noisy version of the video. The local approach focuses on refining the image locally, while the global approach uses a weighted average of the image to produce a final output.

A perspective camera has a fixed length that determines where the image will be formed. The field of view, which is the range of angles that can be seen by the camera, is determined by the width and height of the sensor. The aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the width to the height of the sensor, also affects the field of view.

To create a perspective camera, we need to specify the height and width of the sensor, as well as the field of view with respect to the x and y axes. Once these parameters are known, we can calculate the pixel positions on the sensor that correspond to each pixel in the image.

By understanding the concept of perspective cameras, we can create more realistic and accurate images.

The speaker provides a simplified equation for reflection probability, R, which is the probability that a ray of light will be reflected back into the original medium. The probability of reflection is determined by the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming ray of light and the normal to the surface.

The video also discusses the concept of the index of refraction, N, which is a measure of how well a medium can transmit light. The index of refraction of air is 1, meaning that light travels straight through air without being reflected. However, when light enters a different medium with a higher index of refraction, it is refracted or bent away from the normal.

The video concludes by discussing the probability of reflection for normal incidence, which is the angle of incidence equal to 0 degrees. The probability of reflection is always 1 for normal incidence, meaning that all of the light is reflected back into the original medium. The probability of reflection at 90° is one, meaning that there is a high likelihood that the ray will bounce back off the glass. This is because the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle for refraction, which is 45°. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the light rays are reflected back into the glass.

As the angle of incidence increases above the critical angle, the probability of reflection decreases. This is because the light rays have a greater chance of being refracted instead of reflected. The video discusses the probability of reflection and refraction of light when the medium is vacuum. The probability of reflection is zero when the angle of incidence is 0°, but it increases as the angle of incidence increases.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSB4mqnm5lA,"The video provides an overview of basic and state-of-the-art methods of rendering. It introduces concepts such as radiant flux, irradiance, radiance, and how light is attenuated. The video also discusses the basics of the involved physics, including geometric optics, surface and media interaction with light, and camera models. Additionally, it introduces Monte Carlo methods and their refinement in the form of stratified sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings method.","The video discusses the concept of radiant flux and how it can be measured in a simulation. The speaker explains that radiant flux is the total amount of energy passing through a surface per second, and that it is an important metric for understanding how light interacts with a surface. However, the speaker also acknowledges that radiant flux is not a very good metric for determining the intensity of light, as it does not take into account the angle at which the light is incident.

The speaker then introduces the concept of irradiance, which is the amount of radiant flux per unit area. The speaker explains that irradiance is a more useful metric for determining the intensity of light, as it takes into account the angle at which the light is incident.

Finally, the speaker provides some guidance on how to calculate the irradiance of a surface. The video discusses the rendering equation, a mathematical formula used to calculate the direction and intensity of light reflected or emitted by a surface. The equation involves the dot product of the surface normal and the light vector, which is a measure of how well the surface reflects or refracts light. The video emphasizes that the rendering equation is a complex but essential concept in computer graphics, as it allows artists to create realistic and photorealistic images. The video discusses the concept of light attenuation, where the intensity of light decreases as it travels through a medium. The video provides an example of light attenuation in the case where the Sun is located at a 45-degree angle from the observer. In this case, the cosine of 45 degrees is equal to 1/sqrt(2), which indicates that there is some light attenuation due to the scattering of light particles. The video also discusses the extreme case where the Sun is almost at a 90-degree angle from the observer, where the cosine of 90 degrees is zero, resulting in an infinite amount of light attenuation.","TU Wien Rendering #2 - Radiometry Recap, Light Attenuation",Two Minute Papers

This technique can render translucent objects such as human skin, marble, milk, plant leaves in real time on commodity hardware.","The video describes a method for rendering images with really high quality subsurface scattering in real time on commodity hardware. The method involves taking an infinite half space of a chosen translucent material light and infinitely small pencil beam from above in normal incidence and attenuating it as it penetrates the surface of the material. The photons that exit the material are counted up and used to build a histogram called the diffusion profile. This profile is then convolved with an input irradiance map to add subSurface scattering to it. Horizontal and one vertical convolution for Gaussian kernels is suitable for most real-time applications, but it has not been significantly improved since 2007. The method is not energy-conserving, and the results are often darker than the true kernel. However, a new idea was proposed to solve a minimization problem where the reconstructed kernel would still be as close as possible to the diffusion profile but would also be energy conserving. The video discusses a technique for optimizing the reconstruction of a signal from its noisy version. The technique involves using a guide function to direct the optimizer towards regions of the signal that are far away from the origin. This is achieved by adding a weight function to the loss function that penalizes the magnitude of the difference between the original and reconstructed signals. The technique is particularly effective when the signal has a high degree of energy at the edges, as it can help to preserve these edges while reconstructing the rest of the signal. The video discusses the use of two separable Gaussian functions to provide artistic freedom in scattering processes. The technique allows for the adjustment of the magnitudes of close and foreign scattering, resulting in a variety of artistic effects. While the video primarily focuses on the application of this technique to real-world examples, it emphasizes that it can be used for both scientific and commercial applications.",Separable Subsurface Scattering - Unofficial talk by Károly Zsolnai,Two Minute Papers
