The paper focuses on a specific type of perspective called \"projective perspective,\" which is a perspective that is not linear but instead follows a more complex path. This type of perspective has been shown to be useful for generating more natural and realistic images of portraits.\n\nThe paper proposes a new method for manipulating portrait photos using projective perspective. This method involves using a set of constraints to guide the photo editing process.
