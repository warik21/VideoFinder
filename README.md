# YouTube Video Recommendation Project  

## Background

Ever found yourself aimlessly scrolling through YouTube, searching for that perfect video to watch? Imagine if you could just describe what you're in the mood for using natural language, and instantly get recommendations from your subscriptions. That's the vision behind this project.

We've all been thereâ€”knowing what we want but not finding it amidst the endless sea of content. Our subscriptions are a treasure trove of preferred content, yet YouTube's broad search mechanics often leave us adrift, yearning for a more personal touch.

Enter the YouTube Video Recommendation Project: a beacon for tailored content discovery. By marrying natural language prompts with your curated subscriptions, we're making content discovery not just smarter, but deeply personal. No more wandering. It's time to watch what truly resonates with you, right when you want it.

## Project Overview
This project aims to recommend YouTube videos to users based on their subscriptions and specific natural language prompts. 
By analyzing video metadata and transcripts from subscribed channels, alongside user-provided prompts, the system intelligently identifies and recommends videos that best match the user's interest, thus personalizing the content discovery process on YouTube.
